### About the Data
The data set comprises several sensor data collected from a typical combined system between an inverter, an induction motor, and a control system, deployed on a test bench. Test bench measurements were collected by the LEA department at Paderborn University.

An inverter is a power electronic component with transistors (read 'switches'), that determine how the battery voltage (so called DC-link voltage) is applied on the three phase circuits of the electric motor. The control unit decides according to some control strategy the current switching states of the inverter at each discrete point in time.
